A project based around creating a simple restaurant website which uses js to dynamicaly render the site's content.
Learning goals: utilize and learn more about npm, ES6 modules, webpack, js dom manipulation and Sass.
Styling wasn't the point in this project other than getting to know Sass a bit so it the page may look a rough, might modify on a later date.
